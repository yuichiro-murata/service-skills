name: update-condition-completeness
description: Check a program's 更新条件表(<TableID>) sheets against the table's actual ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ — every column of the table present in the right order, no notnull column left unset on INSERT, every primary-key column set on INSERT and carried as [KEY] on UPDATE/DELETE, and the house conventions for the 共通項目 block (登録者/登録日時 only at INSERT, 更新者/更新日時 on both, 排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ 1 / +1, 更新ﾌﾟﾛｸﾞﾗﾑID=画面ID) honored. Distinct from its siblings: `xlsx-db-column-check` asks whether a referenced column exists at all, `design-doc-io-table-check` asks whether the table is declared in the Ⅲ．入出力定義 CRUD list — this skill asks whether the UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE specification for an already-declared table is complete enough to code from. Use when the user asks to check 更新条件表 completeness, NOT NULL/主キー/共通項目の設定漏れ, 登録日時が更新されていないか, or ｼｽﾃﾑ日時の書式注記(YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS形式)漏れ. When the user asks to REV a single design-doc workbook without naming which checks they want, the entry point is `rev-program-review`: it first asks the user, checkbox-style, which of the 8 single-program checks to run, then runs only those as one combined pass. Do not launch all eight yourself. Run this skill standalone only when it was one of the selected checks, or when the user asked for this check by name.

# update-condition-completeness

Reviews every `更新条件表(<TableID>)` sheet in one program's design-doc workbook against the
authoritative `ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` of the table it updates. The question this check answers is **"could a
coder implement this INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE from the sheet alone, and would the row it writes satisfy
the table's own constraints?"** — not "does this column exist" (that is `xlsx-db-column-check`) and
not "is this table declared in the CRUD list" (that is `design-doc-io-table-check`).

This is the second-largest finding category in the project's own review history: the
第3フェーズ基本設計 指摘傾向レポート puts 更新条件表/DB at 84% of one designer's findings and 35% of
another's, behind only 処理フロー・I/O.

**Called from `rev-program-review`?** Then the workbook is already dumped and the scope is already
chosen — don't re-dump it, don't unconditionally launch the other checks, and don't post a
per-check status update. This skill runs on its own when it was one of the selected checks, or when
the user asked for this check by name.

## Environment constraints (important)

**Where the shared docs live:** the `_shared/*.md` files ship **inside this plugin**, in the
`_shared/` folder next to this skill's own directory (`<plugin root>/skills/_shared/`) — **not** in
`~/.claude/skills/_shared/`, which does not exist on a normal install. Resolve every `_shared/...`
reference below against that folder; if it doesn't resolve, glob
`**/rev-skills/**/skills/_shared/<filename>` and read the hit. Do not skip it and improvise the
Excel COM dump instead: that doc carries the guard against attaching to — and then `Quit()`-ing —
the user's own live Excel session, the strikethrough-exclusion cascade, and the reference-file cache.

Read `_shared/xlsx-excel-com-dump.md` first — it has the PowerShell + Excel COM script this skill
(and its sibling review skills) use to read `.xlsx` files, since this machine has no working
Python/Node to use a library like openpyxl. Its "Folders to always exclude from project-wide
searches" list applies here too.

## Sheet anatomy (measured, not assumed)

Verified against all 13 `更新条件表(*)` sheets of
`01_Doc\08_機能定義書\11_工程管理\PHASE3\PXJCO192_処置指示登録.xlsx`. Confirm the shape holds on the
workbook in front of you before trusting the column numbers — the **labels** are the contract, the
column numbers are just the common case.

```
[8,2]=更新ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ      [8,16]=TXJCM137WF:処置指示ﾏｽﾀWF      ← <TableID>:<table name>
[9,2]=更新概要        [9,16]=①画面(GXJC192A)、②ﾛｸﾞｲﾝ情報   ← defines the ①②… source symbols
[12,2]=更新条件       [12,16]=保存ﾎﾞﾀﾝ押下時 / 分岐条件      ← the trigger, often multi-line
[14,2]=No. [14,4]=項目名 [14,16]=INSERT [14,34]=UPDATE      ← the header row
[15,2]=1   [15,4]=会社ｺｰﾄﾞ [15,16]=② [15,18]=会社ｺｰﾄﾞ  [15,34]=② [15,36]=[KEY]会社ｺｰﾄﾞ
```

Rules that make the parse reliable:

- **The header row is the row with `No.` in col 2 AND `項目名` in col 4.** Do not anchor on row 14.
  Row 13 frequently carries a free-text flow note that happens to contain an operation word
  (`[13,16]=DELETE⇒INSERT`) and will be mistaken for the header by a looser rule.
- **One sheet can hold several blocks.** Half the sheets checked had two or three (e.g.
  `更新条件表(TXJCM137)` has header rows at 14, 68 and 122; `TXJAM026WF` at 14 and 164). Scan the
  whole sheet for header rows and treat each block independently — each has its own 更新ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ,
  更新条件 and operation set. Stopping at the first block silently skips most of the specification.
- **Operation columns are read off the header row, not hardcoded.** Observed label columns: 16, 28,
  34, 40. Accept a cell as an operation only when its text matches
  `^(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|MERGE)[0-9０-９①-⑳]*$`. **The suffix is often a circled digit, not an
  ASCII one** — `TXJAM026WF`'s header reads `INSERT①` / `INSERT②` while `TXJAM027`'s reads
  `INSERT1` / `INSERT2`. An ASCII-only `\d*$` silently drops both circled blocks and reviews only
  the `DELETE`, which is how a first pass over `PXJCO192` missed two thirds of that sheet. Repeated
  plain labels (two bare `INSERT` columns) are real too. This filter matters: several sheets put an
  unrelated
  取得ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ/検索条件 sub-block on the same rows further right (`[14,58]=ﾊﾟﾗﾒｰﾀﾏｽﾀ.ｷｰ1`,
  `[14,58]=共通ｺｰﾄﾞﾏｽﾀ.ｷｰ1`), and a "any non-empty cell to the right is an operation" rule turns
  those into phantom operations.
- **Each operation is two sub-columns: the label column `c` holds the source symbol (`①`, `②`, `-`),
  and `c+2` holds the value.** Confirmed for every observed label column (16→18, 28→30, 34→36,
  40→42).
- **"Not set" means the *value* column is `-` or empty — never the source column.** A column set
  from something other than the screen/login sources legitimately reads `[17,16]=-` with
  `[17,18]=ｼｽﾃﾑ日時`. Judging by the source column alone reports every system-supplied column as a
  missing value.
- **`[KEY]` prefixes the value** and marks the column as part of the WHERE clause for
  UPDATE/DELETE (`[15,36]=[KEY]会社ｺｰﾄﾞ`). A literal in a key position is normal
  (`[28,18]=[KEY]"000"`).
- **Struck-through blocks are already gone from the dump.** The shared dump resolves strikethrough
  live, so a withdrawn 更新条件表 block simply won't be there (in `PXJCO192`,
  `更新条件表(TXJCM137)` is a visible sheet whose entire content is struck out and marked
  `2026/6/10 福浦 削除`). Do not resurrect it from `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt` to review it. A table whose
  update spec was withdrawn but which is still declared in Ⅲ．入出力定義 is a real finding — but it
  belongs to `design-doc-io-table-check`, not here.
- **Hidden sheets are out of scope**, per the shared dump doc's default.
- **A dump record can span several physical lines.** The dump writes one line per sheet row, but a
  cell whose own value contains a newline (a multi-line 更新条件, a `※…`-annotated INSERT value)
  puts that newline straight into the file. Join every line that does **not** start with `[` onto
  the previous line before parsing, or the row is truncated at the newline and every operation
  column after it reads as empty — which looks exactly like "未設定" and produces false C2/C3
  findings. Confirmed on `TXJCM137WF` row 26 (`ﾜｰｸﾌﾛｰID`), whose INSERT value carries a
  `※ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書…` continuation.

## Procedure

### 1. Get the workbook dump

If `rev-program-review` already dumped it, read those scratchpad files. Otherwise dump the workbook
per `_shared/xlsx-excel-com-dump.md`. Only `更新条件表(*)` sheets matter for this check, plus the
機能定義書 and 画面設計書 sheets for the trigger cross-check in step 5 C6.

### 2. Resolve each 更新ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ to its layout file

The `更新ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ` cell gives `<TableID>:<name>`. Resolve the ID to exactly one `ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` file using
**`xlsx-db-column-check`'s step 3 "Quick reference"** — read that section and follow it rather than
re-deriving it. The rules that bite hardest here: the search root is the top-level
`<WG番号>_<WG名>WG\07_データベース・ファイル設計書(仮)` (not nested under `01_Doc`), the ID must match
**exactly** (a `WF` suffix is a different table, and `更新条件表` sheets are full of `*WF` tables), the
`ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` sheet's `A6` cell must confirm the ID, and precedence is PH3 > PH2 > top-level.

Dump all of them in one pass with the **Batch variant** script in the cross-session cache section of
`_shared/xlsx-excel-com-dump.md`, `OnlySheetPatterns = @("ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ")`.

The layout sheet's header is at row 7 and the columns this check needs are:

| col | header | use |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `No.` | column order |
| 3 | `項目名` | the name the 更新条件表 uses |
| 12 | `項目ID` | for reporting |
| 28-35 | `I01`…`I08` | index membership; **`I01` is the primary key** — the digit in the cell is that column's position within the key |
| 36 | `default` | a DB-side default, relevant to C2 |
| 38 | `notnull` | `Y` = NOT NULL |

### 3. Calibrate the house convention from the workbook itself

Before flagging anything about the 共通項目 block, tabulate what **this workbook's own** sheets do for
each common column, per operation. The conventions below were measured on `PXJCO192`, and they held
across its sheets — but they are a project convention, not a written rule, so the workbook's own
dominant pattern wins over this table when the two disagree. Flag a deviation from the workbook's
dominant pattern; do not flag the pattern itself.

Observed standard for the leading common-column block
(`会社ｺｰﾄﾞ/登録者/登録日時/更新者/更新日時/更新ﾎｽﾄ名/更新ﾌﾟﾛｸﾞﾗﾑID/排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ/部門GRP/事業部ｺｰﾄﾞ/移行ｵﾌﾞｼﾞｪｸﾄID`):

| 項目名 | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 会社ｺｰﾄﾞ | 設定 | `[KEY]` | `[KEY]` |
| 登録者 | 作業者ｺｰﾄﾞ | **`-`** | `-` |
| 登録日時 | ｼｽﾃﾑ日時 | **`-`** | `-` |
| 更新者 | 作業者ｺｰﾄﾞ | 作業者ｺｰﾄﾞ | `-` |
| 更新日時 | ｼｽﾃﾑ日時 | ｼｽﾃﾑ日時 | `-` |
| 更新ﾎｽﾄ名 | `-` | `-` | `-` |
| 更新ﾌﾟﾛｸﾞﾗﾑID | 画面ID | 画面ID | `-` |
| 排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ | 何らかの初期値 | 増分 | `-` |
| 部門GRP | 設定 | `[KEY]` | `[KEY]` |
| 事業部ｺｰﾄﾞ | 設定 | `-` | `-` |
| 移行ｵﾌﾞｼﾞｪｸﾄID | `-` | `-` | `-` |

WF tables carry four more after that block — `ﾜｰｸﾌﾛｰID`, `ｸﾞﾙｰﾌﾟID`, `ﾜｰｸﾌﾛｰ申請区分`, `元排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ` —
and the WF sheets in the same workbook are the calibration set for those.

**Do not hardcode `排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ = 1` on INSERT.** A first version of this table did, and running it over
`PXJCO192` produced four false findings in a row: `TSJCM139WF`, `TXJCM838WF` and both of
`TXJAM026WF`'s INSERT blocks set `ﾗﾝﾀﾞﾑ値`, and `TXJAM025WF` sets `※3` (a footnote reference), while
only `TXJCM137WF`/`TXJCM501` use the literal `1`. On this table the initial lock value is a design
choice per table, so the only INSERT-side defect worth reporting is `排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ` left **unset**. On
UPDATE the opposite holds: the value must express an increment (`+1`), because a literal that does
not advance the counter defeats optimistic locking.

### 4. Run the checks

**C1 — 項目リストが実テーブルと一致しているか.** The 更新条件表's `項目名` rows should be the layout's
`項目名` list, in the layout's `No.` order. Report: a layout column with **no row at all** in the
更新条件表 (the sheet was written against an older table definition — the coder has no instruction
for that column); a row whose 項目名 exists in **no** layout column; and a row order that diverges
from the layout (low confidence on its own — report only when it coincides with added/removed
columns, since it is then evidence the sheet was patched by hand rather than regenerated).

**Pair the two directions before reporting.** When a "missing" layout name and an "extra" sheet name
are near-matches — one is a prefix or substring of the other — they are one finding (a rename, or a
key written only in part), not two. `TSJCM139WF` is the live example: the layout's PK7 NOT NULL
column is `工程ｺｰﾄﾞ工程No` and the 更新条件表 row says `工程ｺｰﾄﾞ`. Reported as two lines it reads like
an unrelated deletion plus an unrelated addition; reported as one it says what the reviewer needs to
decide — either the doc carries a stale name, or the sheet is only setting the 工程ｺｰﾄﾞ half of a
concatenated key. (That the project really does concatenate this way is visible in the same
workbook: `TXJCM838WF`'s `指示工程ｺｰﾄﾞ` is set from `G6).指示工程 ※工程ｺｰﾄﾞ部分のみ`.)

This check earns its place: on `PXJCO192`'s `TXJCM501` it found three layout columns —
`停止工程GRP`, `製造ﾛｯﾄNo2`, `解除理由` — with no row in the 更新条件表 at all. Note this only
surfaces if step 2's PH3 > PH2 precedence was applied: `TXJCM501` has a layout file under **both**
phase folders, and the 更新条件表 matches the older one.

**C2 — INSERT で notnull 列が未設定.** For every operation whose label starts with `INSERT` (or
`MERGE`): every layout column with `notnull = Y` must have a non-`-`, non-empty value. An unset
NOT NULL column is a guaranteed runtime failure, so this is the highest-severity finding this check
produces. Two exemptions, both verifiable from the layout: the column has a `default` value (col 36),
or it is the target of a DB-side trigger/sequence noted in 備考 (col 40). State the exemption rather
than staying silent — "notnull だが default 設定あり" is useful to the reviewer.

**C3 — 主キーの扱い.** From `I01` (col 28), build the table's primary key in position order.
- INSERT: every PK column must be set. A missing one means the row can't be identified afterwards.
- UPDATE / DELETE: every PK column must carry `[KEY]`. **A partial key is the important finding
  here** — `[KEY]` on 3 of a 5-column PK means the statement updates or deletes a *range* of rows,
  which is nearly always unintended; if it is intended, the 更新条件 text should say so, so check the
  trigger text before flagging and quote it either way.
  **Exception — suppress it for the DELETE half of a DELETE⇒INSERT block.** Where a block pairs a
  DELETE with one or more INSERTs on the same table, deleting by a partial key is the whole point:
  the statement clears every child row for a parent key and the INSERTs rewrite them. Flagging it
  produced noise on two of `PXJCO192`'s sheets (`TXJCM838WF`, where the DELETE omits `SEQ` from a
  7-column PK, and `TXJAM026WF`, where it omits `工程ｺｰﾄﾞ`), and in both the paired INSERT sets the
  full key. Report a partial key only for a **standalone** DELETE, for an UPDATE, or when the paired
  INSERT does **not** set the full PK.
- A `[KEY]` on a column that is **not** in `I01` is also worth a line: either the doc means a
  non-unique filter (fine, but then see the range warning above) or the PK in the layout is wrong.

**C4 — 共通項目の慣習違反.** Compare each block's common-column rows against the calibration from
step 3. The finding shape that actually shows up: **`登録者`/`登録日時` being set on UPDATE.** This is
not hypothetical — `更新条件表(TXJCM137WF)` in `PXJCO192` sets both on its UPDATE
(`[16,36]=作業者ｺｰﾄﾞ`, `[17,36]=ｼｽﾃﾑ日時(...)`) while every other UPDATE block in the same workbook,
including `TXJCM501`'s and `TXJCM137`'s, correctly leaves them `-`. Overwriting 登録日時 on every
update destroys the record's creation time. Also check: 排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ set to a non-incrementing literal
on UPDATE (the optimistic-lock counter never advances), and 更新者/更新日時 left `-` on an UPDATE.

A full run of C1-C7 over `PXJCO192`'s seven live 更新条件表 sheets produced exactly three findings —
this one, the `TXJCM501` missing columns under C1, and the `TSJCM139WF` name mismatch — with no
C2 or C3 hits. That ratio is the target: this check is meant to be quiet on a clean sheet.

**C5 — 排他制御が更新と噛み合っているか.** If the table has an `排他ﾌﾗｸﾞ` column and the block has an
UPDATE, the 更新条件 (or the 機能定義書's processing overview) should describe the optimistic-lock
comparison, not just the `+1`. `design-doc-internal-consistency`'s check 7 asks whether exclusive
control is mentioned *at all* for a program that updates; this check is the column-level follow-up —
report only what that check wouldn't already have said, and say plainly that it's the 更新条件表 side
of the same concern so the reviewer doesn't see it as two separate defects.

**C6 — 更新条件（トリガ）が書かれていて、画面イベントと対応しているか.** An empty `更新条件` cell is a
finding on its own. When it names a trigger (`保存ﾎﾞﾀﾝ押下時`, `一時保存ﾎﾞﾀﾝ押下時`), that event should
exist in the 画面設計書's event list for the screen the 更新概要 names. A trigger naming a button the
screen doesn't have is a stale copy-paste from another program's sheet.

**C7 — 参照元記号が定義されているか.** Every `①②③…` used in a value or source cell must be defined in
that block's own `更新概要` cell. A dangling `⑥` (used in `TXJCM501`'s UPDATE) means the reader can't
tell where the value comes from. Symbols are **block-scoped** — check against the block's own
更新概要, not the sheet's first one.

**C8 — 日時系の値に書式注記が付いているか.** Scope this check to `更新条件表(<TableID>)` sheets only.
A value cell that supplies a system timestamp must read `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時(YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS形式)` — the
bare `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時` with no format annotation is a finding. The annotation is what tells the coder which
`TO_CHAR`/`TO_DATE` format model to write; without it the column's precision (does it carry the time
part, or only the date?) is left to the implementer to guess, and two programs writing the same
column can diverge. Typical location is the 共通項目 block's `登録日時`/`更新日時` value cells
(`[17,18]`, `[17,36]` and their per-block equivalents), but apply it to **every** value cell in the
sheet whose content is `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時`, common column or not.

Unlike C4, this one is **not** calibrated against the workbook's dominant pattern: the annotated form
is always correct, so flag every bare `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時` even in a workbook where most sheets omit it. Match
on the value cell's full content — `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時` is half-width katakana (`ｼ ｽ ﾃ ﾑ`), and a cell already
carrying any parenthesized 形式 note is fine. A cell that merely *contains* `ｼｽﾃﾑ日時` inside a longer
sentence (a `※` footnote, a free-text 更新条件) is not a value cell — don't flag it.

Report it as 書式注記漏れ, one line per cell, and say the correct form explicitly so the designer can
paste it. This is **not** the same as `design-doc-internal-consistency`'s check 5: that one checks
letter-casing in 画面項目定義's 表示形式 column and explicitly does *not* touch 更新条件表's
`(YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS形式)` — the Oracle format model there is case-insensitive. Casing inside the
annotation is still never a finding; only its absence is.

Measured on `PXJCO192_処置指示登録.xlsx`, where all nine 更新条件表 sheets were scanned: 22 cells carry
the annotated form and 12 carry the bare one, so this is a live, common defect rather than a
hypothetical. The split runs almost exactly along the WF/non-WF line — every `*WF` sheet
(`TXJCM137WF`, `TSJCM139WF`, `TXJAM025WF`, `TXJAM026WF`, `TXJCM838WF`) is fully annotated, while the
plain sheets `TXJAM025` `[17,36]`/`[19,36]`, `TXJAM026` `[17,36]`/`[19,36]`, `TXJCM838`
`[17,36]`/`[19,36]` and `TXJCM501` `[17,18]` are bare. `TXJCM501` is the clearest case: its own
`[19,18]`/`[19,36]`/`[41,18]`/`[42,36]` are annotated and only `[17,18]` is not, so the sheet
contradicts itself.

**Run this check against the live dump, not a raw cell read.** Five more bare cells sit in
`更新条件表(TXJCM137)`, whose whole sheet is struck out and withdrawn — a raw `Value2` scan surfaces
them and a reviewer working from the shared dump will not see them at all. They are not findings.### 5. Verify before reporting

For each candidate finding, re-read the source cells in the dump. The three things that have
produced wrong findings on this shape of sheet:

- reading the **source** column instead of the value column (`c` instead of `c+2`) and reporting
  every system-supplied column as unset;
- anchoring on row 14 and missing the second and third blocks — or worse, comparing block 1's
  operations against block 2's rows;
- treating a right-hand 取得ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ/検索条件 sub-block's header cells as operation columns.

## Reporting

Write in the user's language, for the designer who owns the doc.

Group by 更新条件表 sheet, and within a sheet by block when there is more than one. For each finding:
name the table and the column, cite the sheet and cell (`更新条件表(TXJCM137WF) [17,36]`) with a
clickable `[filename](relative/path)` link to the workbook, and state the consequence in one clause
(NOT NULL 違反で登録できない / 登録日時が更新で上書きされる / 主キーの一部しか指定されておらず複数行が
更新される). Order by severity: C2 and C3 partial-key first, then C4, then the rest.

Omit: sheets that checked out clean, a count of how many sheets/columns were compared, and any
narration of which files you dumped or resolved. The one process fact worth a line is a
更新ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙ whose layout file couldn't be resolved at all — that's a coverage gap, and say which table.
