# Reading Unicorn design-doc Excel files via Excel COM

**Microsoft Excel is installed and reachable via COM automation from PowerShell** — this is the
reliable, fast way to read `.xlsx` contents in this environment, and every `*review*`/`*column-check*`
skill in this skills folder uses the technique below. The scripts here are tuned against these real
workbooks (strikethrough/gray resolution, the UsedRange origin offset, the PID guard), so keep using
them rather than rolling your own reader.

**Correction to an earlier premise: Python and Node ARE available on this machine now.** This file
used to open by asserting they were not (that `python3`/`python`/`py`/`node` all resolved to inert
Windows Store stub launchers). That was true when it was written and is no longer true — measured
`2026-09-14`: `python` is a real CPython **3.13.15** at
the per-user `AppData` Programs Python313 install with **openpyxl 3.1.5** importable, and
`node` is **v24.19.0** under the standard `Program Files` nodejs install. Only the bare `python3` on PATH is
still the WindowsApps stub, so prefer `python`. Do not repeat the old claim, and don't waste a round
trip re-discovering it. Python is genuinely useful for the small side tasks this work throws off —
reading `xl/workbook.xml` out of the zip to list sheet names before deciding what to dump, editing
these skill docs, post-processing a dump — and `unzip` in the Bash tool still works too. It has not
replaced the Excel COM dump for the actual review read, and nobody has validated an openpyxl
equivalent against these workbooks; treat swapping the dump over as a separate, deliberate piece of
work, not something to improvise mid-REV.

One trap when using Python that way: a **Bash heredoc collapses doubled backslashes even when the
delimiter is quoted**, so a `"C:BSBSProgram Files"` literal inside a `python - <<'EOF'` script
arrives as a single backslash and `BSn` becomes a real newline. That silently wrote a line break into
the middle of a Windows path in this very file, twice, and the write succeeds so nothing warns you
(only a stray `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence` hints at it). When a script must contain
backslashes, build them with `chr(92)` or avoid the path text entirely, and read the result back to
confirm. (`BS` above stands for the backslash character, for the same reason.)

## Folders to always exclude from project-wide searches

When any skill searches broadly across the whole `Unicorn` project root (Glob/Grep for a table ID,
a design-doc filename, a DB layout file, etc.), always exclude these path patterns up front —
each confirmed out of scope by the user directly. A file found only under one of these should never
be treated as a real hit (e.g. a table's layout "found" only in `90_Branches/` is not the same as it
being found in the real WG folder structure).

**Quick reference — exclude these from every recursive search's scope:**

- `jira_slack_notifier/**`
- `90_Branches/**`
- `01_Doc/04_共通設計/90_JAGUR各管理台帳/**`
- `*_*WG/開発DDL作成用*/**` (any WG, any date suffix)
- `**/11_単体テスト/**/サンプルデータ/**`
- `**/11_単体テスト/**/参考データ/**`

**Why** (background, skip on a routine run):

- `jira_slack_notifier/` — unrelated internal tooling repo, not a design-doc/DB-layout folder.
- `90_Branches/` — personal/WIP branch copies, not authoritative.
- `01_Doc/04_共通設計/90_JAGUR各管理台帳/` — superseded pre-migration ledger copies.
  `.claude/settings.json` denies `Read` here, but Glob/Grep and the Excel-COM dump script (opens by
  raw path, bypassing the `Read` deny) still see these files — exclude explicitly regardless.
- `<WG>WG\開発DDL作成用<date>\` — always excluded; a former exception for cross-WG table-layout
  lookup no longer applies.
- `.../11_単体テスト/.../サンプルデータ/` and `.../参考データ/` — test-data files whose names match
  real table IDs (e.g. `JAGUR.TXJAM008.csv`); confirmed never real evidence across multiple reviews.

## Don't parallelize a large table/sheet list across your own sub-agents

However large the list (e.g. `PSJCO308_焼成ｻﾔ詰め組み.xlsx`'s 29 更新条件表 sheets, or its 2092-row
画面設計書), work through it yourself, sequentially — do not fan out to your own sub-agents to split
it. Confirmed real failure on `PSJCO308`: both `design-doc-io-table-check` and `xlsx-db-column-check`
split their 29 tables across 4-7 sub-agents each; several got broken/empty prompts and returned
nothing, others were still running when the parent's own turn ended (forcing the orchestrating
session to step in and force a synthesis), and the extra request volume materially contributed to
the session hitting its rate limit. None of it was faster or more thorough than working the list
directly — it only added failure points and cost.

If a list is too large for one pass, work it in batches within your own turn (e.g. 5-10 tables at a
time, repeat) and report any remaining gap explicitly as a coverage limitation — don't silently drop
scope, and don't spin up sub-agents to cover the rest. Only the orchestrating session decides whether
to split a REV across multiple parallel agents.

## Orchestrating session: dump once, share the text, across parallel agents on the same workbook

When several sibling skills (`design-doc-internal-consistency`, `design-doc-io-table-check`,
`xlsx-db-column-check`, `naming-standard-compliance`, `design-doc-formatting-consistency`,
`design-doc-typo-check`) run as parallel background agents against the SAME target workbook, don't
let each one independently dump it from scratch — up to 6x duplicated Excel COM cycles on an
identical file. Confirmed real waste: a review of `XJC_ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`'s `ﾛｯﾄ停止ﾁｪｯｸ` sheet had
3 agents each re-dump the same 999-row sheet because their prompts didn't say to reuse an existing
dump.

Instead: before launching the batch, run the live dump (per "The dump script" below) once yourself
against every sheet, and pass the resulting `.txt` file paths into each agent's prompt ("read
`<path>` for sheet X — don't re-dump it").

**In the same pre-launch step, build the reference-master index if any selected check needs it —
see `_shared/reference-index.md`.** Today that means `design-doc-internal-consistency`, which reads
the 画面項目辞書 index. That doc tells the *agent* not to build the index and to stop if it is
missing, so if you skip this step the check simply does not run. Build one index per dictionary file
the program's IDs route to (that doc's routing table; a program using shared `XJZ`/`SJZ` items needs
the `_共通` file too), subset each to the program's own IDs, and pass both paths per file in the
prompt (the subset to read whole, the full index to grep) — same discipline as the dump.

**The dump script already applies strikethrough and gray-out, so a shared dump now carries
everything all but one skill needs — no agent should run its own strikethrough/gray scan.** Struck
cells are absent from the `.txt` entirely and partially-struck cells carry only their live text, so
"is this row still live?" is answered by whether it appears at all. Removed content is preserved
separately in `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt` for the one check that needs it (see "Excluding struck-through /
grayed-out rows from review" below). Measured on `SXJCB147_処置指示発行(ｻﾌﾞﾌﾟﾛ).xlsx` (7 sheets): the
old shape cost ~155k tokens per agent (raw dump ~105k + strikethrough scan ~49k); the live dump
alone is ~89k (**-43%**), and live + digest is ~117k (-25%). Multiply that by 5-6 parallel agents.

The one remaining exception is `design-doc-formatting-consistency`, which needs `Font.Size` and
`MergeCells` — those still require live COM and are its own concern. Don't try to coordinate that
scan across agents; it costs more than it saves, and only one skill reads it.

## The dump script

Open the workbook invisibly, pull each worksheet's UsedRange as one `Value2` array (do **not**
loop `Cells.Item(r,c)` one cell at a time — it is slow enough to blow past the 2-minute Bash
timeout on any sheet with more than a few hundred cells), cap rows/cols since some sheets have a
bloated UsedRange from stray formatting far beyond the real content, and write one compact text
file per sheet with `[row,col]=value` tokens (skips empty cells, keeps coordinates for citing back
to the source file).

**The dump is a *live* dump: strikethrough and gray-out are resolved while the workbook is open, not
left for each agent to redo.** A fully-struck (or gray) cell is omitted from the `.txt`; a cell with
mixed struck/unstruck characters is written with only its live text; everything removed is written
to a separate `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt`. This is what makes the shared dump self-sufficient — see
"Orchestrating session" above for why, and "Excluding struck-through / grayed-out rows from review"
below for what the digest is for.

Getting that without paying per-cell COM costs needs a **three-level cascade**, because
`Font.Strikethrough`/`Font.Color` return `DBNull` when a range is mixed and a concrete value when it
is uniform:

1. Ask the whole `UsedRange` once. If it comes back "clean" (`Strikethrough = False` and a
   non-gray uniform `Color`), the sheet has nothing to strip — write the plain `Value2` dump and
   move on with **zero** extra COM calls. This is the common case for most sheets.
2. Otherwise ask each row once, over just that row's non-empty column span (3 COM calls per row).
   Rows that come back clean are skipped wholesale.
3. Only for rows that are struck or mixed, walk that row's non-empty cells; and only for cells that
   are themselves `DBNull` do the per-character `Characters(i,1)` reconstruction.

Measured on `SXJCB147_処置指示発行(ｻﾌﾞﾌﾟﾛ).xlsx` (7 sheets, 1089-row worst case, ~2,000 struck and
~390 partially-struck cells): 65s end to end, well inside a 600s timeout. Raise the Bash/PowerShell
timeout for this step rather than skipping the cascade.

**Skip 詳細設計書* and *画面ｲﾒｰｼﾞ* sheets — don't dump their content at all.** Confirmed across every
REV skill's own instructions: most of the single-program skills explicitly say "don't read/dump
詳細設計書 sheets" (it's near-empty boilerplate in practice), and `design-doc-formatting-consistency`
also excludes both 詳細設計書 and the 画面ｲﾒｰｼﾞ mockup sheet from its scan scope (the mockup is a
screenshot image with placeholder cells, confirmed content-free in every program checked so far).
Dumping their full cell content into the shared scratchpad every REV is pure waste — no sibling
skill ever reads those `.txt` files. **Do not extend this to every "ｲﾒｰｼﾞ"-named sheet** — a sheet
like `ﾒｰﾙｲﾒｰｼﾞ` (a batch program's mail-notification template) carries real narrative text that
`design-doc-internal-consistency`/`design-doc-typo-check` genuinely read and have found real
findings in (a stale placeholder wording, confirmed on `PXJCB134_流動停止(ﾊﾞｯﾁ).xlsx`) — only skip a
sheet whose name starts with `詳細設計` or contains `画面ｲﾒｰｼﾞ` specifically, not "ｲﾒｰｼﾞ" generally.

Record each skipped sheet's `UsedRange.Rows.Count`/`Columns.Count` (cheap — no `Value2` pull needed)
instead of a full dump, and report that alongside the rest. This one exception still needs it:
`naming-standard-compliance`'s "表紙's Ⅱ．設計書構成 list vs the sheets actually present" check needs
to tell whether a 詳細設計書 sheet is "populated with real content" or "an empty template" — the row
count alone is normally enough signal for that (a real 詳細設計書 runs dozens of rows; an untouched
template stub is a handful) without needing the full cell-value dump. If that skill's agent genuinely
needs to confirm actual content rather than just row count, it can open the one sheet itself via its
own light Excel COM check — that's still far cheaper than every REV dumping the full sheet by default.

**Format the `Value2` array via a compiled C# helper (`Add-Type`), not a plain PowerShell `for` loop.**
Benchmarked on `XJC_ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`'s `実績表項目設定` sheet (2652×116, ~307k cells): the
PowerShell loop took 7.8s to format vs 55ms for the equivalent compiled C# method — ~140x faster,
verified byte-identical output. The bottleneck is PowerShell interpreter overhead iterating cells in
memory, not the COM call (`Value2` itself pulls in 194ms) — so this costs nothing in correctness and
pays off most on the largest sheets. `ScreenUpdating`/`EnableEvents`/`Calculation` flags were also
tested and made no difference to `Workbooks.Open` time (~5.2-5.9s either way, fixed COM overhead) —
only the formatting loop is worth optimizing.

**`Add-Type` on this machine compiles with warnings-as-errors, so the cell-coordinate key must cast
`c` to an unsigned type before the bitwise OR.** Write `long key = ((long)r << 20) | (long)(uint)c;`
— the shorter `| (long)c` fails to compile with CS0675 ("Bitwise-or 演算子が sign-extended オペランド
で使用されています"), which aborts `Add-Type` entirely and then every `[XlsxDumpHelper]::` call throws
`TypeNotFound`. The failure mode is deceptive: the script keeps running past the errors, so
`Workbooks.Open` succeeds and the per-sheet `.txt` files are written **empty**, and the summary line
still prints a plausible `rows x cols` for each sheet. Verify `Add-Type` compiled (it prints nothing
on success) before trusting any dump.

**Do NOT "verify" it by compiling the helper in a separate PowerShell call first — that produces the
exact same empty-dump failure, for a different reason.** The PowerShell tool does not persist shell
state between calls: types, variables and functions defined in one call are gone by the next. An
`Add-Type` run on its own prints `ADDTYPE_OK` and looks like a clean verification, and then the
next call — the real dump — throws `Unable to find type [XlsxDumpHelper]` on every single row,
keeps running past the (non-terminating) errors, opens the workbook, and writes every per-sheet
`.txt` **empty**, just as a CS0675 failure would. Confirmed for real on `PSJCO304`, where the split
cost a full dump cycle and left an orphaned headless `EXCEL.EXE` behind.

**Always paste `Add-Type` and the code that uses it in the SAME PowerShell tool call.** This applies
to every script in this document and to `_shared/reference-index.md`'s index builder equally. If you
want a compile check, keep it in-line: put `Write-Output "ADDTYPE_OK"` immediately after the
`Add-Type` block of the same call, so a CS0675 failure is visible in the same output as the dump
summary.

**Pass the C# source in a SINGLE-quoted here-string — `Add-Type @'…'@`, never `Add-Type @"…"@`.**
A double-quoted here-string is expanded by PowerShell before the C# compiler ever sees it, so any
backtick in the source is eaten as a PowerShell escape. The concrete failure: the helper's
`sb.Append("\r\n")` was retyped as ``sb.Append("`r`n")`` — PowerShell turned the backtick escapes
into a real CR and LF *inside the C# string literal*, and `Add-Type` died with
`定数の 新しい行です。` (CS1010, newline in constant) followed by a cascade of brace errors. That aborts
`Add-Type` exactly like CS0675 does, with the same deceptive aftermath: the script keeps running,
`Workbooks.Open` succeeds and every per-sheet `.txt` is written **empty**. `$` is expanded the same
way, so a PowerShell variable name that happens to appear in the C# source would also be substituted.
Use `@'…'@` and write `"\r\n"` literally, as the scripts in this document do.

**If a dump call does fail this way, check for an orphaned Excel before retrying.** The script's
`$excel.Quit()` runs but the instance can survive the torn-down PowerShell process. Run
`Get-Process EXCEL | Select-Object Id, StartTime`, compare `StartTime` against `Get-Date`, and
`Stop-Process` only the instance that started within the last minute or two — that one is yours.
**Never kill an older instance: the user routinely has their own Excel open**, and the
pre-existing-PID guard exists precisely because attaching to it and calling `Quit()` force-closes
their unrelated workbooks unsaved. Leaving an idle orphan behind is not harmless either — it is a
Running-Object-Table candidate the next run's `New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application` can attach
to, which the guard then correctly aborts on, blocking every subsequent attempt.

**Never put the character-class literal `[\/:*?"<>|]` in a PowerShell command — build the safe
sheet filename another way.** Confirmed for real while dumping `PSJCO309_焼成入炉帳ｻﾔ組み.xlsx`: the
template's own `$safe = ($n -replace '[\/:*?"<>|]','_')` line makes this environment's
destructive-operation safety guard reject the **entire** command, with a misleading error that names
an operation the script never performs — `Remove-Item on system path '*' is blocked. This path is
protected from removal.` Nothing is executed, so it reads like an environment fault rather than a
one-line lint problem, and it cost several full retries of a 30-sheet dump to localize (bisecting
the script section by section) before the culprit was found. The guard is reacting to the `*` and
`?` inside the class, not to anything the script does. Use the invalid-character list instead, which
carries no wildcard literals and is also more correct:

```powershell
$safe = [string]::Join('_', $n.Split([System.IO.Path]::GetInvalidFileNameChars()))
```

The scripts below already use this form. If you paste a script from anywhere else and hit the
"Remove-Item on system path" error, look for this literal first rather than assuming the guard is
objecting to `Workbooks.Open`, `$wb.Close($false)` or `$excel.Quit()`.

## When Excel refuses to open the workbook at all (0x800A03EC)

Occasionally `$excel.Workbooks.Open(...)` fails on one specific design-doc workbook with
`Workbooks クラスの Open プロパティを取得できません。` / HRESULT `0x800A03EC`, while every other
workbook in the same folder opens fine from the same COM instance. This is **not** a COM quirk, a
busy-Excel problem or a filename problem — it means Excel's loader is rejecting the file's content.
Confirmed for real on `SXJCB147_処置指示発行(ｻﾌﾞﾌﾟﾛ).xlsx` (工程管理/PHASE3), where it cost a long
diagnostic detour before the cause was found.

**The known cause: an out-of-range `<rPh>` (ふりがな) offset in `xl/sharedStrings.xml`.** When an
author shortens a cell's text but Excel doesn't refresh the phonetic-guide runs attached to it, the
saved `<si>` keeps `<rPh sb="…" eb="…">` offsets that point past the end of the (now shorter) `<t>`
text. Excel validates these at load and refuses the whole workbook. On `SXJCB147` the offending
entry was:

```xml
<si><t>「4.処置指示工程」に1件のみ存在</t>          <!-- 17 characters -->
  <rPh sb="26" eb="27"><t>ケン</t></rPh>            <!-- offsets 26/27 and 29/31 are past the end -->
  <rPh sb="29" eb="31"><t>ソンザイ</t></rPh>
  <phoneticPr fontId="31"/></si>
```

**Don't chase the usual suspects first — they were all ruled out on that file** and each cost a
round trip: `unzip -t` reports no error, every XML part is well-formed (`XmlReader` over all
`.xml`/`.rels` entries passes), no `<fileSharing>`/`<workbookProtection>`, no Mark-of-the-Web ADS,
no `~$` lock file, no entry in Excel's `Resiliency\DisabledItems`, the sheet/rels/Content_Types
cross-references are all complete, and the file opens no better with `CorruptLoad` set to
`xlRepairFile` (1) or `xlExtractData` (2), with `UpdateLinks=0`, from a renamed ASCII-named copy, or
after stripping `calcChain.xml` or all twelve dead `externalLinks`. Copying the file elsewhere
doesn't help either — it is the content, not the path or the environment.

### Diagnosing it

Scan every `<si>` and compare each `<rPh>`'s `sb`/`eb` against the length of that entry's own text
(the concatenation of its `<t>` elements **outside** any `<rPh>` block — for a rich-text `<si>`,
concatenate the `<r><t>` runs). Anything with `eb > len`, `sb > len` or `sb >= eb` is a candidate:

```powershell
$ss = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($extractedSharedStringsPath, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)
$body  = $ss.Substring($ss.IndexOf("<si>"), $ss.LastIndexOf("</sst>") - $ss.IndexOf("<si>"))
$items = @([regex]::Matches($body, "<si>.*?</si>", 'Singleline') | ForEach-Object { $_.Value })
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $items.Count; $i++) {
    $noRph = [regex]::Replace($items[$i], '<rPh\b.*?</rPh>', '', 'Singleline')
    $len = (([regex]::Matches($noRph, '<t(?:\s[^>]*)?>(.*?)</t>', 'Singleline') |
             ForEach-Object { $_.Groups[1].Value }) -join '').Length
    foreach ($m in [regex]::Matches($items[$i], '<rPh\s+sb="(\d+)"\s+eb="(\d+)"')) {
        $sb = [int]$m.Groups[1].Value; $eb = [int]$m.Groups[2].Value
        if ($eb -gt $len -or $sb -gt $len -or $sb -ge $eb) { "[$i] len=$len sb=$sb eb=$eb :: $($items[$i])" }
    }
}
```

If that scan comes back empty, bisect instead: rebuild the workbook with parts progressively
replaced by valid stubs (stub every `xl/worksheets/sheetN.xml` down to
`<worksheet …><sheetData/></worksheet>`, minimise `styles.xml`, drop `<definedNames>`, remove
`xl/drawings`+`xl/media`+`xl/printerSettings`+`xl/worksheets/_rels`+`xl/sharedStrings.xml`, adjusting
`[Content_Types].xml` and `xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels` to match) until it opens, then add groups back
one at a time. **Before trusting a single bisect result, rezip a workbook that is known to open and
confirm your rebuild method itself produces an openable file** — `zip -q -r -X out.xlsx
'[Content_Types].xml' _rels docProps xl` from the extracted tree is verified to work. Skipping that
control makes every "still fails" result meaningless. Binary-searching within `sharedStrings.xml`
(keep entries `[lo,hi]` original, stub the rest, swap the part in via
`[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::Open($f,'Update')`) localises the entry in ~12 opens; use
`[Math]::Floor(($lo+$hi)/2)` for the midpoint — PowerShell's `[int]` cast does banker's rounding and
turns `[2831,2832]` into an infinite loop.

### Repairing it, and what to tell the user

**Repair a copy in the scratchpad and dump from that; never rewrite the user's design doc without
asking.** The fix is to delete just the offending `<rPh>` elements (or the `<si>`'s phonetic runs
entirely) — no cell value, font, or merge is affected, so a formatting scan run against the repaired
copy is still valid for the original:

```powershell
Copy-Item -LiteralPath $original -Destination $repaired -Force
$ss = $ss.Replace($badSi, $badSiWithoutRph)
$za = [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::Open($repaired, 'Update')
$za.GetEntry("xl/sharedStrings.xml").Delete()
$sw = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($za.CreateEntry("xl/sharedStrings.xml").Open(),
                                        (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)))
$sw.Write($ss); $sw.Dispose(); $za.Dispose()
```

Then run the normal dump against the repaired copy, tell every downstream agent that the original is
corrupt so none of them wastes time trying to open it, and cite findings against the **original**
path. Report the corruption to the user as a finding in its own right — a design doc nobody can open
in Excel is a bigger problem than anything the REV itself will turn up — and ask before writing the
fix back to the original file.

## UsedRange-relative vs sheet-absolute coordinates

`$used.Value2` is indexed from 1 **within the UsedRange**; `$ws.Cells.Item(r,c)` is absolute on the
sheet. Feeding array indices to `Cells.Item` reads a *different cell* on any sheet whose UsedRange
does not start at `A1`, and it fails silently. This script derives its non-empty column list from
the array, so before the fix every absolute access — the per-row `Range` for the level-2 scan and
the per-cell drill in level 3 — was off by the origin, and the emitted `[row,col]` tokens were off
too.

Both consequences matter, and the second is worse:

1. Strikethrough and gray-out get resolved against the wrong cells, so struck content can survive
   into the dump and live content can be dropped — the exact failure this live dump exists to
   prevent.
2. A finding citing `[10,5]` does not name the cell a reviewer opens. Reviewers navigate by these
   coordinates, so an offset dump makes every finding on that sheet unactionable.

**Measured on the 61 workbooks of `01_Doc\08_機能定義書\11_工程管理\PHASE3`**: 33 of 715 visible
multi-cell sheets do not start at `A1`; after this script's own `詳細設計*` / `*画面ｲﾒｰｼﾞ*` skips,
**12 of 600 in-scope sheets** are affected. Two are worth naming because they are sheets a REV
actually reads: `PXJCB134_流動停止(ﾊﾞｯﾁ).xlsx`'s `ﾒｰﾙｲﾒｰｼﾞ` (offset r1/c1 — the very sheet the skip
rule above carves out an exception *for*), and `SSJCB605_完成割合設定(ｻﾌﾞﾌﾟﾛ).xlsx`'s
`完成割合設定(ｻﾌﾞﾌﾟﾛ)_事業部説明なし` at offset **r33/c34**, where a cited `[5,3]` is really cell
`AK38`. `PXJCO124_ﾛｯﾄ振向け.xlsx`'s two `《参考》画面項目遷移` sheets (881 and 836 rows, r2/c0) and
`PXJCO192_処置指示登録.xlsx`'s `ﾛｯﾄ管理C　処置指示登録` (271x369, r0/c1) are the other large ones.

Reference masters are nearly clean by comparison — 1 of 84 visible sheets across the eight cached
registries and common-design files, and that one is `05.ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`'s
`(参考)配色ﾃﾝﾌﾟﾚｰﾄ`, which no check reads.

**The fix, applied in all three scripts here**: compute `$r0 = $used.Row - 1` / `$c0 = $used.Column - 1`
once per sheet, add it to every `Cells.Item` access, and add it to every coordinate written out. Keep
the internal `dead`/`live` keys array-relative — they index the same array — and offset only at the
boundary. `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt` records absolute coordinates too.

**This changes what cached dumps mean, and the source files did not change**, so mtime/length alone
would report a false cache hit. `meta.json` therefore carries `dumpFormat` (now `2`), compared
alongside mtime and length; a `dumpFormat 1` cache is treated as a miss and redumped. Nothing needs
to be deleted by hand.

### Never compare the cached mtime as a string

`ConvertFrom-Json` on PowerShell 7 silently converts an ISO-8601 string to `[DateTime]`, and that
object's default `ToString()` is `07/28/2026 01:39:58` — no sub-second digits. Comparing it with
`-eq` against the `"o"`-format string the cache was written from (`2026-07-28T01:39:58.8626833Z`) is
therefore **always false**, so every reference file reports a miss and gets re-dumped through Excel
COM on every single run. The cache silently does nothing.

Confirmed on this machine (PowerShell 7.6.6): a `TXJAM023_工程ﾏｽﾀ.xlsx` entry whose `length` and
`dumpFormat` both matched still failed, and a 12-file batch whose cache was fully warm reported all
12 as misses. The `[DateTime]` itself keeps full precision — only its stringification loses it — so
comparing `.ToUniversalTime().Ticks` recovers the match exactly. The `Test-MTimeMatch` helper in both
scripts above does that and accepts either shape, since Windows PowerShell 5.1 and
`ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable` leave the value as a string.

The same trap applies to any other `meta.json` field you add that holds a date. Keep comparisons on
`length`, `dumpFormat` and `sourcePath` as plain `-eq`; those are a number, a number and a string.

### Parsing a dump line

**A logical row is NOT always one physical line.** Cell values in these workbooks routinely contain
newlines — a 属性 cell reading `TextBox⏎※5`, a 初期値 cell reading `新規:空白⏎ｺﾋﾟｰ登録・解除:…` — and
the dump writes the value verbatim, so the rest of that row's `[row,col]=value` tokens continue on
the next physical line(s). Reading the file with `ReadAllLines`/`Get-Content` and treating each line
as a row therefore **silently loses every token after the first embedded newline**.

Confirmed for real, and it produced a wrong conclusion before it was understood: on
`PXJCO128_ﾛｯﾄ停止指示登録.xlsx`'s `画面設計書(GXJC128B)`, row 509's 属性 cell is `TextBox⏎※5`, so the
physical line ends at `[509,18]=TextBox` and `[509,22]`, `[509,24]=30`, `[509,31]`, `[509,34]`,
`[509,36]` all sit on the following line. A line-oriented check read the row as having an empty 桁数,
concluded a real finding was a hallucination, and was only corrected by reading the cell back through
Excel COM. On that one sheet this affects most of the `Ⅴ．画面項目定義` rows.

**So group tokens by the row number inside each `[r,c]=` token, never by physical line.** Scan the
whole file for `\[(\d+),(\d+)\]=` matches and bucket them by `r`; a token's value runs from after its
`]=` up to the next `" | "` or the next `[r,c]=` token, whichever comes first. A quick
`Select-String`/grep for one coordinate is still fine — it is only row-at-a-time reading that breaks.

Within a physical line, split on the literal `" | "` first, then take everything after `]=`
**verbatim** — do not trim the value. Cell values in these workbooks routinely carry significant leading or trailing
spaces (150 of the 980 non-empty cells on `PXJCO192_処置指示登録.xlsx`'s `ﾛｯﾄ管理C　処置指示登録`
sheet alone, including cells that are a single space used as a spacer), which makes a regex like
`\[(\d+),(\d+)\]=([^|]*)` plus a trim silently corrupt them. Verified: parsing verbatim reproduces
all 980 cells of that sheet exactly; the trimming version reported 149 false differences.

## Cross-session cache for reference/master files (not the target workbook)

The "dump once, share the text" section above only dedupes work *within* one REV run, for the one
target workbook under review. It does nothing for the other files a REV skill reads as ground
truth — `04.ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞ管理_*.xlsx`, `09.区分名称_step2.xlsx`,
`05.ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`, `06-*.xlsx` (機能一覧/DB一覧/レスポンス一覧), `07.共通項目取得.xlsx`, the
チェックリスト file, and every テーブルレイアウト workbook. These almost never change between one
program's REV and the next, yet without caching they get re-opened via Excel COM from scratch every
single time, by every agent that needs them — including more than once within the same REV run, when
several sibling skills happen to need the same reference file.

**One exception: `82.画面項目辞書_*.xlsx` is indexed, not cached — see
`_shared/reference-index.md`.** Caching still re-reads whole sheets into an agent's context, and
the only thing any check wants from that file is `id → 画面項目名`. On the 工程管理 copy the index is
between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than the dump it replaces, and smaller again once
subset to one program's IDs — **the figures and the source state they were measured at live in
`reference-index.md`, not here**, so they only have to be refreshed in one place. Do not restate
them here, however tempting: three stale copies is what this pointer exists to prevent. Every other
file listed above — including テーブルレイアウト workbooks and the
`06-*.xlsx` registries — keeps using the cache below; that doc explains why each of those still
needs a builder of its own before it can be indexed safely.

**Use a persistent, cross-session cache keyed by the source file's last-write-time for any file in
this category.** Cache root: `<user home>\.claude\skills\_cache\xlsx-dumps\<md5 of the lowercased
absolute source path, plus an optional sheet-filter suffix — see below>\`, holding one
`<sheetName>.txt` per dumped sheet (same `[row,col]=value` format as above) plus a `meta.json`
recording the source path, `LastWriteTimeUtc`, file length, and which sheet filter (if any) was
used. Before dumping a reference file, compute its current `LastWriteTimeUtc`/length and compare
against `meta.json`: if both match, reuse the cached `.txt` files as-is (no Excel COM call at all —
this is the common case, since these files rarely change); if either differs, or `meta.json` doesn't
exist yet, redump via Excel COM (same safety-guarded approach as "The dump script" above — pre-existing-PID
check included) and overwrite the cache with the new dump plus updated `meta.json`. **Don't wipe the
cache directory with `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` before redumping** — it isn't needed (the
directory is keyed by path + sheet-filter together, so the same cache dir always wants the exact
same set of sheet files every time it's redumped, and `Set-Content`/`WriteAllText` overwrite existing
files in place cleanly) and a recursive delete right next to a literal design-doc filename in the
same script has tripped this environment's own destructive-operation safety guard. Just
`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` (idempotent whether or not the folder already exists) and let
the per-sheet writes overwrite in place.

**Optional: restrict the dump to only the sheets a WG-scoped lookup can ever actually use, via
name patterns.** Two confirmed cases:

- **テーブルレイアウト files** — a table-layout workbook commonly has 4 sheets (checked
  `TXJCM501_ﾛｯﾄ停止.xlsx`): `改訂履歴`, `ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` (the one every skill actually reads),
  `JAG_ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` (an old JAGUR-era copy), `旧ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ` (even older) — only 1 of 4 sheets is ever
  read. Use `$OnlySheetPatterns = @("ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ")`.
- **`04.ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞ管理_<WG>.xlsx`** — confirmed for real on the 工程管理 copy: `04.ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞ管理_工程管理.xlsx`
  has 11 sheets (改訂履歴, 方針, XSA(共通), XSK(共通), XJZ(共通), XJA(基準), XJB(受注), **XJC(工程)**,
  **SJC(工程)**, XJD(品質), XJE(生産)) but the skills' own routing rules (see
  `design-doc-internal-consistency` check 3/4) mean only the reviewed program's own-WG JOBコード
  sheets (bold above) are ever read from THIS file — a common (共通) prefix routes to
  `04.ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞ管理_共通.xlsx` instead, and a foreign-WG prefix routes to that other WG's own file, never
  to a same-named sheet embedded in this one. Use
  `$OnlySheetPatterns = @("XJC(*", "SJC(*")` (or the equivalent for the WG you're checking) —
  `-like` wildcard patterns, not exact names, since a WG's own-prefix sheet can carry an extra
  suffix that an exact-name match would miss. **Leave the pattern open-ended with no closing `)`** —
  `-like` requires a literal `)` to match the actual end of the string, so a closed pattern like
  `"SJC(*)"` fails against a name such as `SJC(工程)再開発追加分 ` (extra text AND a trailing space,
  so it doesn't end in `)`) even though it very much should match; confirmed this exact bug while
  testing against the real 画面項目辞書 file, which carries a sheet named exactly that.

**`82.画面項目辞書_*.xlsx` is not on this list** — it is indexed rather than dumped, so it never
reaches `$OnlySheetPatterns` at all. Its sheet selection is the index builder's business and works
by header detection, not by name; see `_shared/reference-index.md`.

Leave `$OnlySheetPatterns` `$null` (the default) for file types with no such known-safe restriction
(`09.区分名称_step2.xlsx`, `05.ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`, `06-*.xlsx`, `07.共通項目取得.xlsx`, the
checklist file, `04.ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞ管理_共通.xlsx` — these either have few sheets
already or every sheet genuinely gets read by some check). If none of the given patterns match any
sheet in a given workbook (a doc-shape exception), the script automatically falls back to dumping
every sheet and says so — it never silently drops content.

**Important: do not save this as a standalone `.ps1` file and invoke it with `-File` or dot-sourcing
— this environment's endpoint security (Cylance Script Control) blocks executing a `.ps1` file
outright, even via dot-sourcing.** Always paste the script inline as the PowerShell tool's command,
exactly like "The dump script" above.

Read the resulting `<sheetName>.txt` files with the Read tool exactly as you would a fresh dump —
the cache is transparent to every downstream check in this document; only the redump step is
skipped when the source file hasn't changed. **This mechanism is specifically for reference/master
files, not the target design-doc workbook under review** — that one keeps using the plain "dump
once, share the text" flow above (it's reviewed once and the text is only needed for the duration of
that one REV, so a persistent cache buys nothing there and would only grow the cache directory with
one-off entries).

### Batch variant: checking many reference files in ONE Excel session

**Use this instead of the single-file version above whenever you already know you need to check more
than a couple of reference files up front** — most commonly, every テーブルレイアウト file for the
tables in a program's Ⅲ．入出力定義 list (`xlsx-db-column-check`, easily 10+ tables), or every
テーブルレイアウト file in a WG folder (`db-design-cross-consistency`, easily dozens). The single-file
script launches and quits a whole `Excel.Application` COM instance (Add-Type, `New-Object`, the
pre-existing-PID safety check, `Quit`/`ReleaseComObject`) per file — real, non-trivial overhead that
multiplies by file count if you paste it once per file. The batch variant checks every file's cache
validity FIRST, with no Excel interaction at all, and only launches a single shared `Excel.Application`
for the whole batch if at least one file actually needs a redump — so once the cache is warm (a
second REV of the same WG, or `xlsx-db-column-check` re-checking a table `db-design-cross-consistency`
already dumped), this typically launches Excel zero times.

Same freshness semantics as the single-file version (mtime + length + sheet-filter all folded into
the cache key), same Cylance constraint (paste inline, never save as a standalone `.ps1`), and the
same read-the-resulting-`.txt`-files-with-Read-tool usage afterward. Build the `$Files` list from
whatever table IDs/paths you already resolved (e.g. step 3's phase-precedence resolution in
`xlsx-db-column-check`) before running this once, rather than looping the single-file script
per table.

## Excluding struck-through / grayed-out rows from review

**This is already done for you. Do not run your own strikethrough or gray-out scan.** The dump
script resolves both while the workbook is open: fully-struck and gray cells are absent from the
`.txt`, and partially-struck cells carry only their live text. A row you can see in the dump is
live; a row that was struck simply is not there. Re-deriving this per agent was the single largest
source of duplicated cost (~49k tokens × 5-6 agents) **and** of false findings — see "What this
prevents" below.

Read this section to understand what the dump has already decided on your behalf, and when to reach
for `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt`.

### Why the content is excluded at all

Design docs are often copied from an older workbook and edited in place. This project's writing-rule
checklist (`01_Doc/99.共通資料/設計書記述ルール/05.設計書記述ルール_チェックリスト.xlsx`, sheet
"ﾁｪｯｸﾘｽﾄ", item 1-5) says authors should delete struck-through rows entirely and turn red
"to-be-fixed" text back to black when reusing a workbook this way — but that cleanup is often
skipped, leaving struck-through/grayed rows still physically present. **Content marked this way is
inactive/deleted-in-spirit and must never be treated as something the program actually
references** — don't count it toward a "referenced columns" list, don't flag it as a
naming/consistency violation, don't cite it as evidence of what the current design does. Note that
red alone does *not* mean deleted (red is the "to-be-fixed" marker and is still live); only
strikethrough and gray are.

A one-line "N struck-through/grayed cells excluded at dump time" note in the final report is enough —
never enumerate them as findings. The per-sheet `dead=`/`partial=` counts the dump script prints are
exactly that number.

**An empty or near-empty live dump for a sheet is meaningful, not a dump failure.** When an entire
更新条件表/画面設計書 sheet comes back struck top to bottom — including its own header — the correct
read is that the **whole sheet is superseded** (commonly: an old JAGUR-era 更新条件表(<TableID>)
sheet that a newer 更新条件表(<TableID>WF) sheet has replaced). Exclude the whole thing from the
review and say so. Per explicit user direction, red+strikethrough always means "exclude from REV
scope" in this project, with no exception for how broadly it is applied — do not reason your way out
of it ("this can't be meaningful, it's on every row including the header, must be leftover noise").
That reasoning has been tried and explicitly overruled.

### When to read `_DELETED_DIGEST.txt`

The digest holds what was removed, grouped into contiguous row blocks, with `DEL` (whole cell),
`GRAY` (whole cell, gray) and `PART` (`raw=` vs `live=` for a partially-struck cell) entries. Only
structural filler is left out — a bare row/condition number, a hyphen placeholder, a comparison
operator — and each block still reports how many it dropped (`+ N filler cells omitted`). Short but
meaningful cells are listed in full: `(5)`, `※2`, an alias `Y`, `引数`, `ﾗﾝｸ` and the like all
survive the filter, because deletion asymmetries usually hang on exactly those.

Most checks never need it — they are asking "is what the doc *currently* says correct?", and the live
dump answers that directly. Reach for the digest only when a finding turns on **what was deleted**,
which in practice is `design-doc-internal-consistency`:

- A section whose counterpart was deleted while it stayed live — e.g. a ※-note whose only reference
  was removed, or a "(通常/識別ｶｰﾄﾞ)" wording left behind after the 識別ｶｰﾄﾞ output rows were deleted.
  The live dump shows the survivor; only the digest shows that its partner is gone.
- A step-number or branch table with a hole in it, where the missing branch was struck rather than
  renumbered.
- A "削除" revision note sitting next to content that is *not* struck — a real and load-bearing
  ambiguity (confirmed on `SXJCB147`'s `帳票設計書(RXJC042)` 検索条件 No.5, where the surrounding
  same-day deletions *were* struck and this one was not).

If you are about to report a section as "a leftover that should have been deleted but wasn't cleaned
up," check the digest first — it may already be marked dead, in which case there is nothing to fix.
Confirmed for real on `XJC_ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`, sheet `ﾛｯﾄ停止ﾁｪｯｸ`, rows 829-832 (a
"結合条件(A INNER JOIN B)" block left over after its alias B was reassigned from a real table to a
delegated get-item sub-block): a review reported this as a live, not-yet-cleaned-up defect, but every
cell in the block was `Font.Strikethrough=True` — it had already been correctly deleted, and the
"defect" was a pure false positive.

### What this prevents

Every one of these was a real false finding produced by an agent doing its own scan, or skipping it:

- **Six tables reported as "used but not declared in the I/O table"** (PXJCO193), entirely because
  the scan was skipped on a 1000+ row sheet whose 参照ｴﾝﾃｨﾃｨ blocks were red-and-struck-through 100+
  rows deep. Sheet size was exactly why the scan mattered most, and exactly why it got shortcut.
- **`帳票設計書(RSJC035)`'s `注意事項備考` reported as a column that doesn't exist in `TXJCM137`**
  (`SXJCB147`, cells `F202`/`Q202`): raw text was `注意事項備考` / `A.注意事項備考`, but only
  `注意事項` was live. TXJCM137 has `備考` and `注意事項` as separate columns — the doc was correctly
  referencing the latter with a stale, not-fully-deleted `備考` glued on.
- **`COUNT(A.層数層No)` reported as referencing a nonexistent column** and "fixed" to
  `COUNT(A.層No)` (`PXJCO124_ﾛｯﾄ振向け.xlsx`, `ﾁｪｯｸ処理設計書(GXJC124A)`, `[280,17]`) — `層No` was
  already the live text; `層数` was the struck leftover. The doc was already correct.
- **`"GSXJC205A"` reported as a typo of the screen ID `GSJC205A`** (`PSJCO205_返品処置指示発行.xlsx`,
  `画面設計書(GSJC205A)`, `[333,28]`) — only the `X` was struck; live text was an exact match.
- **`③④` treated as two live entity references** (`PSJCO205`, `更新条件表(TXJCM006)`, rows 74/84/95,
  col 16 取得元) when only `④` was live — the sheet's own row-9 legend documents the renumbering that
  stranded `③`.

The last four share one shape: a **mixed-formatting cell**, where `Font.Strikethrough` returns
`System.DBNull` rather than `True`/`False`. That is why the dump script drops to per-character
reconstruction on exactly those cells. The trap is that `System.DBNull` interpolates into a
PowerShell string as an *empty string* — `Write-Output "strike=$whole"` prints `strike=` whether the
value is `False` or `DBNull` — so an ad-hoc scan can read "mixed" as "not struck, live" and never
notice. Test the type explicitly (`-is [System.DBNull]`) and never eyeball a printed value. The dump
script does this; a hand-rolled scan usually doesn't.

### One judgment call the dump can't make for you

**Parallel `処理区分="..."の場合` (or similarly-named) branch variants inside one sheet.** A common
shape in this project's 画面設計書 is two or more parallel sub-blocks handling different values of the
same discriminator (e.g. `品目コード` vs `管理No`, one per branch), often followed by several more
sub-blocks that logically belong to just one of those branches. When one branch is deprecated, the
strikethrough frequently covers not just that one block but every subsequent block that depended on
it too, spanning hundreds of rows and several numbered sub-sections in a row.

In the live dump this appears as a *gap* — a discriminator with no handling. Whether that gap is a
correct deprecation or a genuine design hole is the finding, and it needs the digest plus your own
reading of the surrounding branch structure. `SXJCB147`'s 部門GRP="SC200"(SMD) row, left with no
帳票 after RSJC034/RSJC036 were deleted, is the canonical example of the "genuine hole" case.

## Font-size and cell-merge irregularity detection — moved

That technique is specific to `design-doc-formatting-consistency` and now lives in its own file,
`_shared/xlsx-formatting-scan.md`, so the other 5 REV skills don't pay the token cost of a section
they never use. Only `design-doc-formatting-consistency` needs to read that file.

## Program structure variants to expect

Every REV skill's procedure is written assuming the "default" shape — one プログラムID, one 画面ID,
one 画面設計書 sheet. Two real variants recur often enough in this project that they're worth
checking for up front, before assuming a section is simply missing or that a skill's default
evidence-source doesn't apply:

**A program can have NO 画面設計書 sheet at all** — this happens for a pure batch program (プログラムID
ends in `B`, e.g. `PXJCB102`, `PXJCB134`) or a report-only サブプロ (`S`-prefixed, e.g. `SXJCB147`).
Confirm this from 表紙's "Ⅱ．設計書構成" list (画面設計書 row marked `-`/`-`) before concluding
anything about screen-item checks doesn't apply. When there's no 画面設計書, the column-level
get-item evidence (参照ｴﾝﾃｨﾃｨ blocks, 取得項目/検索条件/結合条件) that a screen program would carry
in 画面設計書's "Ⅲ．画面表示仕様" instead lives in one of two places, and both need checking:
- **機能定義書's own "Ⅳ．機能処理概要"** — a pure batch program (no 帳票設計書 either, e.g.
  `PXJCB102`, `PXJCB134`) writes its 参照ｴﾝﾃｨﾃｨ blocks directly inline in this narrative section,
  numbered as sub-steps (e.g. "(2).共通ｺｰﾄﾞﾏｽﾀより完了予定日に加算する月数を取得する。" followed by
  its own 参照ｴﾝﾃｨﾃｨ/取得項目/検索条件 block).
- **Each 帳票設計書(<ReportID>) sheet's own get-item blocks** — a report-generating サブプロ
  (`SXJCB147` is the confirmed example) delegates almost all of its actual table access to its
  帳票設計書 sheets' own "Ⅲ．編集仕様" sections, each with the same 参照ｴﾝﾃｨﾃｨ/取得項目/検索条件/
  結合条件/ｿｰﾄ順 shape as a screen's get-item block — 機能定義書 itself may carry only one or two
  such blocks (or none) and just says "帳票設計書通りとする。" for the rest. Don't stop at "this
  program's 機能定義書 barely references any tables" — check every 帳票設計書 sheet too before
  concluding a declared table is unused, or that a table used in a report isn't declared.

**A single プログラムID can pair with MORE than one 画面ID** — confirmed for real on
`PSJCO304_着手ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞﾒﾝﾃﾅﾝｽ.xlsx`: one プログラムID (`PSJCO304`) pairs with two screens, `GSJC304A`
and `GSJC304B`, each with its own `画面設計書(GSJC304A)`/`画面設計書(GSJC304B)` sheet and its own
`ﾁｪｯｸ処理設計書(GSJC304A)`/`ﾁｪｯｸ処理設計書(GSJC304B)` sheet — while sharing a single set of
更新条件表 sheets and a single Ⅲ．入出力定義 table in one 機能定義書 sheet. Confirm the actual sheet
list before assuming "one 画面設計書" — if there's more than one, run every per-screen check (event↔
processing-overview, screen-item ID dictionary, message ID, three-way match, item-order consistency,
DB-column extraction) **separately for each screen**, and when verifying I/O-table usage, search
*all* screens' get-item blocks (not just the first one you find) before calling a table "unused."
Also expect a `ﾌｧｲﾙ出力仕様書(<FileID>)` sheet to show up alongside multi-screen programs like this —
treat its own get-item blocks (if any) the same way as a 帳票設計書's, per the batch-program note
above.

## 区分名称/区分コード lookups — always use the STEP2 file directly, and match the group name exactly

A design doc's ※-note frequently delegates a code→label lookup to `ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.区分名称`,
naming a specific group (e.g. "区分名称 ﾛｯﾄ停止区分(ﾛｯﾄ停止指示登録) を参照"). **Always go straight
to `01_Doc/04_共通設計/09.区分名称_step2.xlsx`, sheet `区分名称_STEP2～`, as ground truth** — per
explicit user direction, this is a standing rule, not a per-run judgment call. Do not open the
unsuffixed `01_Doc/04_共通設計/09.区分名称.xlsx` at all (it's a superseded older version), and don't
probe the folder for some other/higher `_stepN` variant each time — STEP2 is the one to use, always.

**Independently of file version, a single 区分名称 file can carry more than one group with very
similar names — an old group and its renamed/expanded replacement coexisting side by side** — so a
keyword search alone (e.g. searching for "ﾛｯﾄ停止区分") can silently match the wrong one. Confirmed
for real: `09.区分名称_step2.xlsx`'s "区分名称_STEP2～" sheet contains BOTH a plain **`ﾛｯﾄ停止区分`**
group (row 846, an old code scheme: `4`=ﾃｰﾌﾟﾛｯﾄNo, `5`=波及範囲検索, `6`=製造ﾛｯﾄNo, no `C`/`D`) AND a
separately-named **`ﾛｯﾄ停止区分(ﾛｯﾄ停止指示登録)`** group (row 2249, the current scheme actually used
by `XJC_ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`'s `ﾛｯﾄ停止ﾁｪｯｸ` sheet: `4`=品目ｺｰﾄﾞ+ﾃｰﾌﾟﾛｯﾄNo, `5`=製造ﾛｯﾄNo,
`6`=品目ｺｰﾄﾞ+製造ﾛｯﾄNo(部分一致), through `C`/`D`). A review that matched on the shorter/plainer name
without checking the design doc's own ※-note for the EXACT full group name in parentheses reported a
"stale master, codes don't match" defect that was entirely a wrong-lookup false positive — the
correctly-named group matched the live design doc's codes perfectly. Always copy the group name
verbatim from the design doc's own delegation note (including any parenthesized qualifier) and match
it exactly against the 区分名称 sheet's group-header cells, rather than fuzzy/keyword-matching the
first similarly-named group found.

## Seeing the actual screen layout (画面設計書 Ⅰ.画面ﾚｲｱｳﾄ)

The `Ⅰ.画面ﾚｲｱｳﾄ` section's cells are **empty in every dump** — the layout is a floating picture, not
cell content, so a text dump can never show it. When a check needs the visual layout (item placement,
which group frame an item sits in, whether a control is drawn at all), get the picture instead:

- **Do not** try `Range.CopyPicture` + `ChartObjects().Add` + `Chart.Paste` + `Chart.Export`. It runs
  without error against an invisible Excel instance but writes ~200-byte blank PNGs, because the
  clipboard round-trip does not work headless. (`$ws.ChartObjects` also needs the parenthesised
  `$ws.ChartObjects()` form in PowerShell, or `.Add` reports "does not contain a method named 'Add'".)
- **Do** unzip the workbook and read `xl/media/` directly — no Excel at all:
  `[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead($xlsx)`, then extract entries under `xl/media/`.
  The layouts are usually `.emf` (vector); convert each with
  `System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile` → `Bitmap` → `Save(...,ImageFormat::Png)` at ~1.6x scale, then
  Read the PNG. `.png` entries in the same folder are typically pasted screenshots of the *old*
  (JAGUR-era) screen from the `画面ｲﾒｰｼﾞ*` sheet, often carrying review annotations — useful history,
  but not the current design; the `.emf` files are the current layout.
- Map picture → sheet by listing `$ws.Shapes` per sheet (`Type=13` is a picture) and comparing
  `Top`/`Width`/`Height` against the media entries' sizes; a 画面設計書 sheet typically holds one
  picture for the main screen plus one per 明細の続き strip.

`pdftoppm` is not installed, so exporting a sheet to PDF and reading its pages does not work either.

## Operational notes

- **Never write the dump script to a `.ps1` file and run it — pass it INLINE in the PowerShell
  tool's `command` parameter.** This machine runs Cylance Script Control, which blocks PowerShell
  from executing script *files*: the call fails with exit code 34 and the single line
  `Cylance Script Control has blocked PowerShell from running.` — no other diagnostics, and nothing
  identifies the script file as the cause. Inline commands are not blocked, and the whole dump
  script (including its `Add-Type` heredoc) passes fine inline. Confirmed on the `PXJCO124` REV,
  where writing `dump.ps1` to the scratchpad and invoking it with `&` failed this way while the
  identical text run inline succeeded. Note also that shell state does not persist between
  PowerShell tool calls, so `Add-Type` and the dump loop must be in the **same** call regardless.
- **Excel's COM server can die mid-dump, and the failure is loud but the output is silently
  wrong.** Seen on the `PXJCO124` REV: partway through the third sheet every subsequent COM call
  started returning `The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA)`, followed
  by hundreds of `You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression` errors as `$ws.Cells`
  returned null. Because the errors are non-terminating by default, the script ran to completion:
  it still wrote per-sheet `.txt` files (the `Value2` arrays already fetched were intact) and still
  printed a summary — but the strikethrough/gray resolution for that sheet and every sheet after it
  was abandoned partway, and the later sheets were never written at all. The tell is in the summary
  line: the crashed sheet reports `0x0` for its `UsedRange` size, and sheets are missing from the
  output directory. Set `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` so the run aborts at the first RPC error
  instead of producing a plausible-looking partial dump, delete the partial output, and simply
  re-run — the same command succeeded on the immediate retry, so treat this as transient rather
  than a reason to change approach.
- **Always check the dump's own row/col cap against the sheet's real size before trusting a "not
  found" result.** The template script's default cap is 3000 rows / 160 cols (raised from an
  earlier 500/100 default specifically because that was too low for this project's real sheets and
  caused a recurring wasted round-trip: dump at 500 → a section silently missing past row 500 →
  redump the same sheet at a higher cap → re-read. Confirmed sheet sizes that would have tripped the
  old cap: `PSJCO308`'s 画面設計書 (2092 rows), `XJC_ｼｽﾃﾑ共通設計書.xlsx`'s `実績表項目設定` (2652
  rows) and `ﾛｯﾄ停止ﾁｪｯｸ` (999 rows, 126 cols), `09.区分名称_step2.xlsx`'s `区分名称_STEP2～` (2371
  rows, 156 cols) — the new default covers all of these in one pass. Still, don't treat 3000/160 as
  a guarantee: re-check `$used.Rows.Count`/`$used.Columns.Count` from the sheet (printed when you
  dump it) against the cap, and if a sheet is bigger than even this default, redump just that sheet
  with an explicitly higher cap before concluding a section or ID is actually missing.
- Reuse a single `$excel` instance across many files (loop the whole batch inside one PowerShell
  call) instead of relaunching Excel per file — much faster, and this project has hundreds of
  design-doc workbooks per WG.
- `$excel.Visible = $false` and `$excel.DisplayAlerts = $false` before opening anything; always
  `$wb.Close($false)` per file so it doesn't prompt to save.
- If a run times out or errors, clean up the specific hidden instance this script started before
  retrying — a stale instance keeps file handles locked and blocks subsequent opens:
  `Stop-Process -Id $excelComPid -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
  **Never run `Get-Process EXCEL | Stop-Process -Force`** (or any other kill-by-process-name
  form) — `EXCEL.EXE` is shared with any Excel window the user has open for unrelated work, and
  killing by name force-closes those too, discarding unsaved edits. Always target the exact PID
  captured via `$excelComPid` (or the equivalent for each instance, if a run opens more than one).
- **Always run the pre-existing-PID check in the dump script above before touching `$wb`/`$excel`
  at all.** This project has already hit the case where `New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application`
  attached to the user's own running Excel instead of creating a new hidden one — the PID-targeted
  kill guard above only protects the error-cleanup path, it does nothing for this failure mode,
  since the normal end-of-script `$wb.Close($false)` / `$excel.Quit()` calls are exactly what force-
  closed the user's unrelated open workbook the one time this happened. If the check throws, stop
  and tell the user rather than working around it.
- Then read the dumped `.txt` files with the Read tool (not `cat`/Bash) — the `[row,col]=value`
  format is compact enough to scan quickly and lets you cite exact cells back to the user.
- Table/column-layout workbooks in `07_データベース・ファイル設計書(仮)`-style folders follow a
  fixed template: a **"ﾃｰﾌﾞﾙﾚｲｱｳﾄ"** sheet with the table ID/name at row 6
  (`[6,1]=<TableID>` / `[6,6]=<Table name>`), header at row 7
  (`No. | 項目名 | 項目ID | 属性 | 桁数 | DB桁 | I01... | notnull | 備考`), and one data row per
  column from row 8 onward — `[r,3]` is the Japanese column name (項目名), `[r,12]` the physical
  column id, `[r,19]`/`[r,23]` the DB type/length.
- Program/screen design workbooks (機能定義書系) follow a fixed sheet set: 表紙 → 機能定義書 →
  画面設計書 → 詳細設計書 / ﾁｪｯｸ処理設計書 → 更新条件表(<TableID>) — section headers use Roman
  numerals (Ⅰ．Ⅱ．Ⅲ...) which are stable anchors to grep/read for across programs.
